# K-Means-Clustering
I developed a K-Means clustering model using a countries dataset to categorize countries based on key metrics. The model analyzes attributes like population, GDP, and area, identifying distinct clusters that group countries with similar characteristics, offering valuable insights for data-driven decision-making and analysis.
